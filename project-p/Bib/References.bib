	abstract = {Smart organizations know they can no longer afford to see maintenance as just an expense.
	Rather, maintenance must be integrated within the business cycle in order to guarantee
	predictability, growth and increase the overall quality of operations. Moving from a regime of
	scheduled rule-based maintenance via on-condition maintenance and ultimately to a data-driven
	risk-based regime can lead to more accurate and timely maintenance tasks. This smarter view of
	maintenance allows for achieving many practical advantages leading to lower costs and increased
	safety and availability of ship systems.},
